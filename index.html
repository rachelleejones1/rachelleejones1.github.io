        <p>My name is Rachel Jones. I grew up in the Seattle area. I went to Bainbridge High School where I did running start at Seattle Central CC for my last two year. After high school, I moved to Boise to attend Boise State. I fell in love with Boise and wanted to make a life there. It is still my goal to move back there as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>My favorite pasttimes are cooking with my best friend Ginny, spending time with my adorable nieces, Blakely and Maisy, and cuddling with my two dogs, Buster and Tux.</p>
        <p>In college, I studied criminal justice with the goal of attending law school. Through a series of life events, I decided law school wasn't in my near future, so I found myself wondering what my future career would look like. Having had several menial jobs since college, I have found myself more and more interested in web development. I have tried teaching myself basic coding, but always got frustrated when I got stuck and couldn't find a solution on my own. I'm really excited to be in the UW Coding Bootcamp to finally learn web dev with the resources to see it through!</p>
